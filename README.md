# stardew_valley_macro

Macro based on [this thread](https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/a-better-animation-canceling-autohotkey-script.7391/), but using python.

## How to use it

```bash
$ pip3 install requirements.txt
$ python3 macro.py
```
After you install the dependencies and run the script you could use the letter `u` to run the macro and `esc` to exit.
